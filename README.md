# Weather Widget with AngularJS
Weather Widget 1.0.0 for AngularJS

This is the DEMO project of the weather widget angular.

Very easy-to-use widget to show weather forecast, based on AngularJS, using the openweathermap API.

Visit https://github.com/sergiolealdev/WeatherWidgetAngularJS to see the weather widget as bower component to install in your app.

###How to install

Just clone this repository, and run `bower install` to create the directory with the dependencies of the project.

You may also want to run install http-server with `npm install -g http-server` to have a little HTTP Server to run the app. Once installed, you just have to run `http-server` in the directory of the app in order to run the content in the server.

Once we have all up and running, we can see the content of the widget addressing our browser to:

`http://localhost:8080/app.html`
